- Units Sold comparison
- Profit Margin chart

## 📄 Page 3 — Product-Level Detailed Table

### Includes:
- Product Name  
- Revenue  
- Profit  
- Units Sold  
- Profit Margin  

### **Key Insights**
- Road Bike Pro, Endurance Bike S, and Aero Bike X generate the highest revenue, despite all having negative profits.

- Products with high units sold also contribute to large negative profit, indicating high cost structure or deep discounting.

- High profit margin % values in the table are due to negative profit vs. revenue calculation — meaning the products are unprofitable, but the metric appears inflated.

- Lower-priced accessories like Water Bottle and Cycling Cap generate low revenue and also show losses.
